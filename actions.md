# Actions Taken to Make firmware_downloader.py Work on macOS

## 1. Installed Missing Dependencies

- **requests**: Was imported but not in requirements.txt
- **All requirements.txt packages**: Installed via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- **fusepy**: Python binding for libfuse (required by mtk.py)

## 2. Fixed Missing Image File

- **presteps.png**: Was referenced in code but missing from `mtkclient/gui/images/`
- **Solution**: Copied `initsteps.png` to `presteps.png` as a temporary placeholder

## 3. Enhanced Error Handling for Backend Issues

### Added New Signal
- **backend_error_detected**: New signal in MTKWorker class to detect libusb backend errors

### Enhanced Error Detection
- **NoBackendError detection**: Added detection for "nobackenderror" and "no backend available" in MTK output
- **Improved error handling**: Errors are now detected but don't immediately stop MTK output reading

### Added User-Friendly Error Messages

#### Backend Error (libusb Backend Issue)
- **Cause**: Missing or incompatible libusb backend, system USB driver conflicts, incompatible macOS version
- **Solution**: Install/update libusb via Homebrew, restart system
- **User Action**: Click OK to open Homebrew installation page

#### Handshake Failed Error
- **Windows**: Install WinFSP and UsbDk drivers, reboot, or use Driver Setup package
- **macOS**: Install FUSE (fuse-T or macFUSE), update OpenSSL, restart system

## 4. Improved User Experience

- **Continuous MTK Output**: Status bar continues to show mtk.py output even after errors are detected
- **Informative Error Messages**: Clear explanations of what caused the error and how to fix it
- **Platform-Specific Instructions**: Different solutions for Windows vs macOS users

## 5. System Requirements for macOS

- **FUSE**: Must have fuse-T or macFUSE installed
- **OpenSSL**: Should be up-to-date (can be updated via Homebrew)
- **libusb**: Python fusepy module requires system libusb library

## 6. Notes

- **No changes to mtk.py**: The script works as expected and is responsible for USB functions
- **firmware_downloader.py**: Only detects and reports errors from mtk.py, provides user-friendly solutions
- **fuse-T preference**: The solution uses fuse-T instead of macFUSE as requested
- **Error propagation**: Backend errors from mtk.py are caught and displayed with helpful resolution steps

## 7. Testing

The script now runs successfully on macOS and provides clear error messages when backend issues occur, guiding users to install the necessary system dependencies.

## 8. Enhanced Error Image Handling

### Platform-Specific Error Images
- **Windows Handshake Errors**: Display `handshake_err_win.png` for 50 seconds
- **macOS Handshake Errors**: Display `handshake_err_mac.png` for 50 seconds
- **Keyboard Interrupts**: Display `process_ended.png` for 50 seconds

### Error Image Behavior
- **Automatic Display**: Error images are shown immediately when errors are detected
- **50-Second Display**: All error images are displayed for exactly 50 seconds
- **Return to Ready State**: After error display, application automatically returns to `presteps.png` (ready state)
- **User Guidance**: Appropriate error messages and resolution steps are shown based on platform

### Error Detection
- **Handshake Failed**: Detected in MTK output, shows platform-specific error image
- **Backend Errors**: Detected in MTK output, shows user-friendly resolution steps
- **Keyboard Interrupts**: Detected in MTK output, shows process ended image
- **Errno2 Errors**: Detected in MTK output, shows reinstall instructions

### User Experience Improvements
- **Visual Feedback**: Users immediately see what type of error occurred
- **Platform Awareness**: Different error images and messages for Windows vs macOS
- **Automatic Recovery**: Application returns to ready state without user intervention
- **Clear Instructions**: Each error type provides specific resolution steps
