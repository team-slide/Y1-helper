## Innioasis updater frozen after downloading firmware and starting to install:
Just end the task / force quit the app and restart it, make sure that the Y1 and all non essential USB devices are NOT plugged into your PC, then follow the on screen instructions carefully, click Try Again when the app opens back up and if this doesn't work try one of the other methods in the app.

## Firmwares not installing:
Make sure the blue Driver Setup button isn't showing in your app, if it does you're missing one of the drivers needed for both methods (Method 1 and 2 use MTKclient, and Method 3 uses SP Flash Tool)

## Windows app doesn't work at all:
If for some reason the Windows app doesn't work at all for you, don't worry, you can download firmwares from firmware.innioasis.app then extract the zip into the Innioasis Updater folder (right click start menu shortcut and Open File Location) and use one of the shortcuts in the Troubleshooting folder 

## Fix Stuck Updates
If you have a stuck update, reboot your computer and start Innioasis Updater again from the start menu, it will then update fine, and this shouldn't happen again in the future.

If this doesn't work, right click on your Innioasis Updater shortcut, and look for the Fix Stuck Updates folder, if you don't have one you can download the zip at troubleshooting.innioasis.app
