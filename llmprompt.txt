Create a macOS .app that when run will

Check an internal file to see if it’s the first run, perhaps use a plist for this.

If it is it’s first run
Check if homebrew is installed and if not, install it for the user…


— commands —
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Install and configure macFUSE and openssl for the user 
brew install macfuse openssl

Clone github.com/team-slide/Innioasis-Downloader into a subdirectory of the .app’s resources directory

Create a python virtual environment inside the .app and install the python scripts’ dependencies

— commands —
python3.9 -m venv mtk_venv
source mtk_venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --pre --no-binary capstone capstone
pip3 install PySide6 libusb
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
— end of commands —

Then ask the user to Reboot their Mac and run the app again.

For this and subsequent runs, launching the app can just run firmware_downloader.py in its venv for the user. 

Ensure that the main script firmware_downloader.py will be able to call other scripts if needed and that all will be afforded read/write access.
